This tool takes search parameters and a selection of websites and opens up a new Firefox window with a Google search containing your search parameters over each of the specified websites. Effectively, all this does is open a new Firefox window with a different "inurl" flag.

This tool was made to reduce the tedium in open source intelligence gathering engagements.
